## <a name="About WA+"></a>About WA+

[Water Accounting Plus](http://wateraccounting.org/index.html) Water accounting is the process of communicating water resources related information and the services generated from consumptive use in a geographical domain, such as a river basin, a country or a land use class; to users such as policy makers, water authorities, managers, etc.

There are several packages available, which include python. The WA+ team recommends to download the python package of Anaconda. The great advantage of using the standard Anaconda package is that most of the commonly used modules are included in the package. Alternatively, these modules can be installed separately by the user if a different package than Anaconda is preferred.

Anaconda can be downloaded from: [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads). It is recommended to download  the 64 bits version, because this will increase the calculation capacity enormously. However, be sure that your computer/laptop is a 64 bits computer/laptop.

The WA+ python codes are made for python version 2.7 for Windows operating systems. It is therefore necessary to download this version of python for running WA+ tools. Major changes are made to the python codes and functions if you compare 2.7 with 3+ versions. It is therefore not possible to run WA+ code in python 3+ versions without making some changes to the code.
